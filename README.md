## The Neural Network

![](resources/images/ArtificialNeuronModel_english.png)

- The network receives a series of x values between 0 and 1
- The weights (w) are initialized to random numbers
- The main neuron performs some processing on the inputs and weights
  - The neuron calculates a weighted sum of the inputs and normalizes the result by perfoming this: ![](resources/images/CodeCogsEqn.png)
